# Angular-Components-Cards

- All angular apps are made of multiple different components.
- Each component is designed to implement one 'thing' in the app that is visible on the screen.
- A component wraps up all the HTML and code to make one little widget work correctly.
- A component can be nested or shown inside of each other
- Every app has a component called the 'App' component, and it is always the most parent component.
